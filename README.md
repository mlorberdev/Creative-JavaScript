# Generative-Art

This is a collection of past vanilla JavaScript generative art projects, duplicating or elaborating on some of the first generation artists' work by analyzing & synthesizing their readily-apparent algorithms. No libraries or outside sources were used or consulted while undertaking this project. This gallery will generate a random work each time one of the dozen script buttons is clicked.
